# PLAN mailbox

2026-04-21 follow-up note

While hardening the semver/browser bundle path and aligning the proof-summary docs, the schema-doc regression suite revealed that `plan/phase-4/02-formal-verification-depth.md` still lacks the canonical proof-backed summary text and theorem inventory snippets that are already used in `README.md`, `proofs/BOUNDARY.md`, and the spec chapters.

Proposed fix:
- add the canonical short summary to the Stage 4.2 plan file
- mirror the proof-summary theorem inventory snippets already pinned in the spec set so the plan prose stays in sync with the repository's proof-backed boundary wording
