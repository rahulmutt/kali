## 2026-04-17 — Stage 4.2 zero-count collection follow-up

I widened the current RC snapshot proof slice with a local freeing step: `releaseAndCollect` now filters zero-count cells after the decrement pass, and the new theorem inventory should mention that zero-count collection explicitly alongside the existing release/decrement bookkeeping.

Suggested follow-up:
- sync `proofs/BOUNDARY.md`, `specs/17-verification.md`, `specs/19-feature-maturity.md`, and `README.md` so the proof-backed boundary names the zero-count collection slice
- keep the broader Stage 4.2 ownership/freeing target narrower than this local collection helper
